          Al-Salāmu 'Alaykum wa rahmatullāhi wa barakātuhu <br/> My name is Abdullah
          Gibril Jalloh.I attended the "Al-Qudus Islamic Institute" in the
          Republic of Sierra Leone. Currently, I am teaching Qur'ān & Hadeeth
          for children at the "Madrasatu al-Hidāyah Quranic School" in Waterloo,
          Sierra Leone. Neither am I working, nor being employed. Rather, I have
          only been engaged in teaching the Book of Allah for approximately 1
          year now. And so far, I have 70+ students striving to learn the Book
          of Allah. In order to further nurture those children, we are kindly
          asking for sponsors in our Quranic School to provide more financial
          aid for them. May the blessings of Allah continue to shine upon the
          Madrasah, and may our students find success and guidance in their
          journey of learning the sacred knowledge. Jazakumullahu khairan for
          your support and consideration.
